NAME

    Imager::DTP - draw text with DTP app-like custom options

DESCRIPTION.

    Imager::DTP is a text drawing add-on for Imager, with ability to draw
    text horizontally or vertically (from top to bottom), letter-based (not
    word-based) text wrapping for multi-byte characters, line alignment, and
    adjustment of distance between letters and lines. Vertical drawing and
    letter-based text wrapping are for multi-byte character languages, such
    as Japanese and Chinese.

  MORE THAN WORDS

    I've made an interactive sample viewer page, for quick and essential
    understanding of what the output will look like, by using Imager::DTP.
    You can make the output more complexing and fancy by making full use of
    the module, but save that for later, and just take a glance at all the
    basics.
